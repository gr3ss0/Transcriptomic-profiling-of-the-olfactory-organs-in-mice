GO:0001706	endoderm formation	The formation of the endoderm during gastrulation.	N/A
GO:0007492	endoderm development	The process whose specific outcome is the progression of the endoderm over time, from its formation to the mature structure. The endoderm is the innermost germ layer that develops into the gastrointestinal tract, the lungs and associated tissues.	N/A
GO:0001704	formation of primary germ layer	The formation of the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm during gastrulation.	N/A
GO:0045229	external encapsulating structure organization	A process that is carried out at the cellular level which results in the assembly, arrangement of constituent parts, or disassembly of external structures that lie outside the plasma membrane and surround the entire cell.	N/A
GO:0043062	extracellular structure organization	A process that is carried out at the cellular level which results in the assembly, arrangement of constituent parts, or disassembly of structures in the space external to the outermost structure of a cell. For cells without external protective or external encapsulating structures this refers to space outside of the plasma membrane, and also covers the host cell environment outside an intracellular parasite.	N/A
GO:0007369	gastrulation	A complex and coordinated series of cellular movements that occurs at the end of cleavage during embryonic development of most animals. The details of gastrulation vary from species to species, but usually result in the formation of the three primary germ layers, ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm.	N/A
GO:0032963	collagen metabolic process	The chemical reactions and pathways involving collagen, any of a group of fibrous proteins of very high tensile strength that form the main component of connective tissue in animals. Collagen is highly enriched in glycine (some regions are 33% glycine) and proline, occurring predominantly as 3-hydroxyproline (about 20%).	N/A
