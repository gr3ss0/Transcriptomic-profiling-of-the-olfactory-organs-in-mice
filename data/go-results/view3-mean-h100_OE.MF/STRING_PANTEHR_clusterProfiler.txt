GO:0015453	oxidoreduction-driven active transmembrane transporter activity	Primary active transport of a solute across a membrane, driven by exothermic flow of electrons from a reduced substrate to an oxidized substrate. Primary active transport is catalysis of the transport of a solute across a membrane, up the solute's concentration gradient, by binding the solute and undergoing a series of conformational changes. Transport works equally well in either direction and is driven by a primary energy source.	N/A
GO:0009055	electron transfer activity	A molecular function representing the directed movement of electrons from one molecular entity to another, typically mediated by electron carriers or acceptors, resulting in the transfer of energy and/or the reduction-oxidation (redox) transformation of chemical species. This activity is fundamental to various biological processes, including cellular respiration and photosynthesis, as well as numerous enzymatic reactions involved in metabolic pathways.	N/A
GO:0008137	NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) activity	Catalysis of the reaction: NADH + ubiquinone + 5 H+(in) = NAD+ + ubiquinol + 4 H+(out).	N/A
GO:0003735	structural constituent of ribosome	The action of a molecule that contributes to the structural integrity of the ribosome.	N/A
GO:0015078	proton transmembrane transporter activity	Enables the transfer of a proton from one side of a membrane to the other.	N/A
