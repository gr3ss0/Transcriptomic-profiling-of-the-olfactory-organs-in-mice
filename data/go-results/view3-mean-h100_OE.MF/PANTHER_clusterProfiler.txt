GO:0022853	active monoatomic ion transmembrane transporter activity	Enables the transfer of an ion from one side of a membrane to the other up the solute's concentration gradient. This is carried out by binding the solute and undergoing a series of conformational changes. Transport works equally well in either direction.	N/A
GO:0015399	primary active transmembrane transporter activity	Enables the transfer of a solute from one side of a membrane to the other, up the solute's concentration gradient, by binding the solute and undergoing a series of conformational changes. Transport works equally well in either direction and is powered by a primary energy source. Primary energy sources known to be coupled to transport are chemical such as ATP hydrolysis, redox energy and photon energy.	N/A
GO:0003954	NADH dehydrogenase activity	Catalysis of the reaction: NADH + H+ + acceptor = NAD+ + reduced acceptor.	N/A
GO:0016655	oxidoreductase activity, acting on NAD(P)H, quinone or similar compound as acceptor	Catalysis of an oxidation-reduction (redox) reaction in which NADH or NADPH acts as a hydrogen or electron donor and reduces a quinone or a similar acceptor molecule.	N/A
GO:0016651	oxidoreductase activity, acting on NAD(P)H	Catalysis of an oxidation-reduction (redox) reaction in which NADH or NADPH acts as a hydrogen or electron donor and reduces a hydrogen or electron acceptor.	N/A
GO:0022804	active transmembrane transporter activity	Enables the transfer of a specific substance or related group of substances from one side of a membrane to the other, up the solute's concentration gradient. The transporter binds the solute and undergoes a series of conformational changes. Transport works equally well in either direction.	N/A
