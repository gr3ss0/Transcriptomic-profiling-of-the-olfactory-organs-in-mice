GO:0034185	apolipoprotein binding	Binding to an apolipoprotein, the protein component of a lipoprotein complex.	N/A
GO:0140993	histone modifying activity	A catalytic activity that acts on a histone protein. Reversible histone modifications contribute to regulation of gene expression.	N/A
GO:0030247	polysaccharide binding	Binding to a polysaccharide, a polymer of many (typically more than 10) monosaccharide residues linked glycosidically.	N/A
GO:0071813	lipoprotein particle binding	Binding to a lipoprotein particle. A lipoprotein particle, also known as a lipoprotein, is a clathrate complex consisting of a lipid enwrapped in a protein host without covalent binding in such a way that the complex has a hydrophilic outer surface consisting of all the protein and the polar ends of any phospholipids.
