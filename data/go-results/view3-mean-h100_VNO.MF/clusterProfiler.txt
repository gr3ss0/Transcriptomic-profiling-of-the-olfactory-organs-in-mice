GO:0140313	molecular sequestering activity	Binding to a specific molecule to prevent it from interacting with other partners or to inhibit its localization to the area of the cell or complex where it is active.	N/A
GO:0046933	proton-transporting ATP synthase activity, rotational mechanism	Enables the synthesis of ATP from ADP and phosphate by the transfer of protons from one side of a membrane to the other by a rotational mechanism driven by a gradient according to the reaction: ADP + H2O + phosphate + H+(in) -> ATP + H+(out).	N/A
GO:0003746	translation elongation factor activity	Functions in chain elongation during polypeptide synthesis at the ribosome.	N/A
