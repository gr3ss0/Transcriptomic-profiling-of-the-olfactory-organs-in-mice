GO:0141052	histone H3 demethylase activity	Catalysis of the removal of a methyl group from a modified lysine residue of the histone H3 protein. This is a dioxygenase reaction that is dependent on Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate.	N/A
GO:0032452	histone demethylase activity	Catalysis of the removal of a methyl group from a histone.	N/A
GO:0140457	protein demethylase activity	Catalysis of the removal of a methyl group from a protein.	N/A
GO:0032451	demethylase activity	Catalysis of the removal of a methyl group from a substrate.	N/A
GO:0016706	2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase activity	Catalysis of the reaction: A + 2-oxoglutarate + O2 = B + succinate + CO2. This is an oxidation-reduction (redox) reaction in which hydrogen or electrons are transferred from 2-oxoglutarate and one other donor, and one atom of oxygen is incorporated into each donor.	N/A
GO:0051213	dioxygenase activity	Catalysis of an oxidation-reduction (redox) reaction in which both atoms of oxygen from one molecule of O2 are incorporated into the (reduced) product(s) of the reaction. The two atoms of oxygen may be distributed between two different products.	N/A
GO:0016705	oxidoreductase activity, acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen	Catalysis of an oxidation-reduction (redox) reaction in which hydrogen or electrons are transferred from each of two donors, and molecular oxygen is reduced or incorporated into a donor.	N/A
GO:0051864	histone H3K36 demethylase activity	Catalysis of the removal of a methyl group from a modified lysine residue at position 36 of the histone H3 protein. This is a dioxygenase reaction that is dependent on Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate.	N/A
GO:0140993	histone modifying activity	A catalytic activity that acts on a histone protein. Reversible histone modifications contribute to regulation of gene expression.	N/A
